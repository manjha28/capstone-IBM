2.2. Data Cleaning
Actions taken on each dataset:
Neighborhood Names and Zipcodes:
• None
Latitude and Longitude for Neighborhoods:
• The longitude for the Outer Richmond neighborhood returned by uszipcode is incorrect. I have resorted to Google Maps to find the correct one and updated the data frame accordingly.
Restaurant Violations:
• Dropped all rows older than January 1st 2019
• Removed columns not relevant to our analysis
• Kept only data for neighborhoods in San Francisco City
